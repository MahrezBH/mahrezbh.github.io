üì¶ **How to Upload Files to Hetzner Object Storage with Rclone on Linux**

If you've ever tried uploading files to Hetzner Object Storage using tools like Cyberduck or the official `duck` CLI and faced connection issues ‚Äî you're not alone. The `duck` CLI sometimes struggles with Hetzner‚Äôs custom S3-compatible endpoint.

Luckily, **rclone** offers a reliable, flexible alternative that works smoothly on any Linux distribution, including Debian, Arch, Fedora, and others.

This guide will walk you through setting up rclone on your Linux system to upload files easily to your Hetzner bucket.

```bash
sudo apt install rclone
````

* **Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S rclone
```

* **Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install rclone

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Rclone for Hetzner

You can set this up interactively or by editing the config file.

#### Option A: Interactive Setup

```bash
rclone config
```

* Choose `n` for a new remote
* Name it (e.g., `hetzner`)
* Select `s3` as the storage type
* Choose `Other` as the provider
* Enter the endpoint URL (e.g., `https://hel1.your-objectstorage.com`)
* Enter your Access Key and Secret Key
* Leave region blank or enter `hel1`
* Accept defaults for other options

#### Option B: Edit Config File

Edit or create `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` with:

```ini
[hetzner]
type = s3
provider = Other
env_auth = false
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
endpoint = https://hel1.your-objectstorage.com

Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` accordingly.
